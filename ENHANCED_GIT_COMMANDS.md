✓ Git command completed: status
  M  src/app.js
  ?? new-file.txt

auto-git> git log --oneline -5
✓ Git command completed: log --oneline -5
  abc123f feat: add new feature
  def456g fix: resolve bug
  ghi789h docs: update readme
```

### Auto-Detected Subcommands
```bash
auto-git> log --graph --oneline -10
✓ Git command completed: log --graph --oneline -10
  * abc123f feat: add new feature
  * def456g fix: resolve bug
  * ghi789h docs: update readme

auto-git> branch -a
✓ Git command completed: branch -a
  * main
    feature-branch
    remotes/origin/main
    remotes/origin/feature-branch

auto-git> stash push -m "Work in progress"
✓ Git command completed: stash push -m Work in progress
  Saved working directory and index state On main: Work in progress
```

### Advanced Git Operations
```bash
auto-git> git rebase -i HEAD~3
✓ Git command completed: rebase -i HEAD~3
  [Interactive rebase editor opens]

auto-git> git cherry-pick abc123f
✓ Git command completed: cherry-pick abc123f
  [abc123f] feat: add new feature

auto-git> git bisect start
✓ Git command completed: bisect start
  status: waiting for both good and bad commits
```

## 🛠️ Error Recovery Examples

### Example 1: Push Without Upstream
```bash
auto-git> push origin feature-branch
✗ Git command failed: push origin feature-branch
  Error: fatal: The current branch feature-branch has no upstream branch.

🤖 AI Suggestion:
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use:
  git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch

This will:
1. Push your local commits to the remote repository
2. Set up tracking between your local and remote branch
3. Allow future pushes with just 'git push'

Would you like me to explain what these suggested commands do? (y/N) y

🎓 Command Explanations:
  git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch
    → Uploads local commits and sets up tracking between local and remote branch

💡 Pro tip: You can run these commands directly in this REPL!

auto-git> git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch
✓ Git command completed: push --set-upstream origin feature-branch
  Branch 'feature-branch' set up to track remote branch 'feature-branch' from 'origin'.
```

### Example 2: Merge Conflict Resolution
```bash
auto-git> merge main
✗ Git command failed: merge main
  Error: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/app.js
         Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

🤖 AI Suggestion:
You have merge conflicts that need to be resolved manually:

1. Open the conflicted file(s) and resolve conflicts:
   - Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>
   - Choose which changes to keep
   - Remove the conflict markers

2. After resolving conflicts:
   git add src/app.js
   git commit

3. Or to abort the merge:
   git merge --abort

Would you like me to explain what these suggested commands do? (y/N) y

🎓 Command Explanations:
  git add src/app.js
    → Stages the resolved file for commit
  git commit
    → Creates a merge commit with the resolved conflicts
  git merge --abort
    → Cancels the merge and returns to the previous state

auto-git> status
✓ Git command completed: status
  UU src/app.js  # Unmerged file with conflicts

# After manually resolving conflicts...
auto-git> add src/app.js
✓ Git command completed: add src/app.js

auto-git> commit
✓ Git command completed: commit
  [main abc123f] Merge branch 'main'
```

### Example 3: Rebase Conflicts
```bash
auto-git> rebase main
✗ Git command failed: rebase main
  Error: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/utils.js
         error: could not apply abc123f... feat: add utility function

🤖 AI Suggestion:
You have a rebase conflict. Here's how to resolve it:

1. Resolve conflicts in the affected file(s):
   - Edit src/utils.js to resolve conflicts
   - Remove conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

2. After resolving conflicts:
   git add src/utils.js
   git rebase --continue

3. Or to abort the rebase:
   git rebase --abort

4. Or to skip this commit:
   git rebase --skip
